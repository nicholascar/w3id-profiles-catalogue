  <h1>URI List Profile</h1>
  <p>This <em>profile</em> is a data model that is for lists of URIs. It is entirely described by the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">Media Type</a> <a href="https://w3id.org/mediatype/text/uri-list">https://w3id.org/mediatype/text/uri-list</a>.</p>
  <p>The reason for assigning this URI, <code>https://w3id.org/profile/uri-list</code> to this profile, rather than just re-using the Media Type URI, <code>https://w3id.org/mediatype/text/uril</code>, is so that descriptions, like this, can be made that help with the use of the profile <em>as a data spacification</em>, not just as a format.</p>
  <p>In addition to human-readable descriptions of this profile, this text, there is also a machine-readable description of this profile available which uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/">Profiles Vocabulary</a> to describe this profile in Semantic Web terms and which relates it various parts together (guidance documents like this, specification docs, format checkers etc.).</p>
  <p>This machine-readable version is available by using <em>Content Negotiation</em> against this URI, <code>https://w3id.org/profile/uril</code>, to get information according to the Media Type <code>text/turtle</code>, for example, this <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> command:<p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>curl --header 'Accept: text/turtle' https://w3id.org/profile/uril</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>For convenience, this machine-readable version is also available via this direct link:</p>
  <ul><li><a href="https://w3id.org/profile/uril.ttl">https://w3id.org/profile/uril.ttl</a></li></ul>
  <p><em>As of November, 2019, this machine-readable version, and this document you are reading now, are not complete but they hopefully will by by the end of 2019.</em></p>
